The line vty 0 4 command refers to virtual terminal lines (VTY lines) on a Cisco device, which are used 
for remote access such as Telnet or SSH.

Here's a breakdown of what line vty 0 4 means:

line vty: This specifies the virtual terminal lines, which are logical lines used for remote login sessions.
VTY lines allow you to connect 
to the router or switch remotely using protocols like SSH or Telnet.

0 4: This defines the range of VTY lines being configured. In this case, 0 4 represents 5 VTY lines (lines 0 through 4).
Most Cisco routers and switches come with 5 default VTY lines (0 to 4), meaning up to 5 remote users can connect
to the device simultaneously.

In short:
VTY lines enable remote access to a router or switch.
0 4 means you are configuring the first 5 virtual lines (from 0 to 4), allowing up to 5 concurrent remote login sessions.
When you enter line vty 0 4, any configuration commands you apply afterward (such as enabling SSH access) will 
apply to all VTY lines in that range, meaning remote users connecting to any of those lines will follow the same access rules.

For example:

bash
Copy code
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh

This ensures that all VTY lines (0 to 4) will require local login and only accept SSH connections.



#### SIMPLE WAY TO CONFIGURE SSH IN CISCO ROUTER OR SW


Router(config)# hostname MyRouter
MyRouter(config)# ip domain-name example.com
MyRouter(config)# crypto key generate rsa
How many bits in the modulus [512]: 2048
MyRouter(config)# username admin privilege 15 secret StrongPassword123
MyRouter(config)# ip ssh version 2


MyRouter(config)# line vty 0 4
MyRouter(config-line)# login local
MyRouter(config-line)# transport input ssh
MyRouter(config-line)# exit
MyRouter(config)# ip ssh time-out 60
MyRouter(config)# ip ssh authentication-retries 3
